Power Query (ETL) → Extract, Transform, and Load process

Power BI → Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard creation, and interactive visualization

🔑 Key Features

✔️ Data cleansing and preprocessing in Excel

✔️ ETL pipeline using Power Query (removing duplicates, handling nulls, standardizing formats)

✔️ Data modeling and relationships in Power BI

✔️ Interactive dashboards with KPIs, charts, slicers, and filters

✔️ Insights & recommendations for decision-making

📂 Project Workflow

Data Extraction → Import raw datasets (CSV/Excel/SQL)

Data Cleaning & Transformation → Handled missing values, outliers, duplicates

Data Loading → Load transformed dataset into Power BI

Data Modeling → Define relationships, calculated fields, DAX measures
